:description: CCWP is a grassroots social justice organization, with members inside
  and outside prison, that challenges the institutional violence imposed on women,
  transgender people, and communities of color by the prison industrial complex (PIC).
  We see the struggle for racial and gender justice as central to dismantling the
  PIC and we prioritize the leadership of the people, families, and communities most
  impacted in building this movement.  www.prisonerswithchildren.org
