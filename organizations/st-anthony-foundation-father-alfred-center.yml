:description: The St. Anthony Foundation’s Father Alfred Center provides the Bay Area’s
  only licensed no-fee residential recovery program to homeless men who are ready
  to build sober, stable futures. The program serves men from San Francisco, Marin,
  Alameda, Contra Costa and San Mateo counties.  The Father Alfred Center’s year-long
  work-structured program empowers men with no income or resources with the tools
  to overcome addiction, and the support to establish productive and healthy lives.
  The multi-program access available through St. Anthony’s own services is rare in
  the field of recovery, and allows the speedy assessment and resolution of clients’
  medical, legal, vocational and educational needs, most or all of which have been
  affected profoundly by their cycles of poverty and addiction.
