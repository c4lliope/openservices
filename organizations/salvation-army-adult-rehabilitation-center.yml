:description: The Salvation Armyâ€™s Adult Rehabilitation Centers provide spiritual,
  social and emotional assistance for men and women who have lost the ability to cope
  with their problems and provide for themselves.  Each center offers residential
  housing, work, and group and individual therapy, all in a clean, wholesome environment.
  The physical and spiritual care that program participants receive prepares them
  to re-enter society and return to gainful employment. Many of those who have been
  rehabilitated are reunited with their families and resume a normal life.
:eligible_population: Must be an adult male and healthy enough to work. Drug & Alcohol
  Free Environment. No SSI, Unemployment, or Disability Recipients.
