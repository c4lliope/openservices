:description: Our Homeless Services Program works specifically with individuals facing
  homelessness and the multitude of related challenges. This program offers employment
  and comprehensive support services to homeless individuals and families in Alameda
  County. This Program is primarily supported by a Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
  grant, which provides for housing stabilization, case management, and in-house counseling
  for those facing chronic homelessness as well as community members more recently
  impacted by the economic downturn. Goodwill provides these support services at our One
  Stop Homeless Employment Center in downtown Oakland.   Goodwill’s “Bridges to Work”
  initiative helps our homeless participants secure transitional employment and job
  training, and, once skills are established, search for competitive employment. 
  In 2013, our Homeless Services Program served 622 individuals and continues to meet
  high demand for their services as community members continue to struggle with rising
  unemployment and subsequent instability in their housing.
