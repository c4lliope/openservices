:description: The San Francisco District Attorney’s Back on Track Initiative is a
  court-driven program for offenders ages 18-30 who are charged with their first adult
  felony drug sales offense.   Defendants accepted into Back on Track spend a minimum
  of one year attending progress hearings and commit to complete community service,
  obtain their high school diploma/GED, and find employment.  We partner with Criminal
  Justice Specialists at Goodwill Industries, who both monitor individuals’ progress
  and assist with job training, job placement and other critical supports.  Successful
  participants have their cases dismissed and arrest records sealed.
:eligible_population: Young adults in the criminal justice system. There are additional
  requirements; please call for more information.
