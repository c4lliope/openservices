  How to Sign Up for the Master Lease Program:
  If you are a CAAP Recipient: Any client who is active and listed as homeless with their County Adult Assistance Program (CAAP) worker is eligible for master lease hotel housing. Check with your CAAP worker during your monthly Homeless Residency verification appointment regarding housing opportunities.  Your CAAP worker is the only person who can provide you with this information.

These include: MSC South, Next Door, Hospitality House, Episcopal Sanctuary, A Woman's Place, Larkin St., Dolores St. or the Homeless Outreach Team.
