:description: Village Connect’s CBTC’s mission is to build capacity of people to become
  more self-aware and self-directed resulting in sustainable positive transformation.  Our
  philosphy of change is steeped in a culturally competent approach that is client-centered
  and sensitive to the gender-specific and inter-generational dynamics critical to
  the individual and group.    CBTC is a strength-based coaching model that maximizes
  personal, professional, and academic potential.  Coaches/Facilitators trained in
  the CBTC model support clients to meet life’s opportunities and challenges by providing
  insights and guidance from an inside/out perspective rather than outside/in.  Utilizing
  a culturally proficient curriculum and community-based interdisciplinary approach,
  Village Connect effectively transforms the individual, family, and community.
