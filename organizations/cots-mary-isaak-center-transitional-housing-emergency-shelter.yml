:description: Committee on the Shelterless (COTS) Mary Isaak Center facility is the
  setting for the majority of COTS' programs and services. These programs help families
  and single adults to heal from trauma and homelessness, gain life skills, optimize
  their income, and acquire permanent housing. We know that trauma influences how
  people respond and live in the world. If we do not deal with this history, it is
  extremely difficult to help people move forward.  The second floor of the building
  is dedicated to the Family Transitional Housing program, which provides shelter
  and a wide range of transformative programs for up to 11 families at a time. Families
  may stay for up to two years, during which time they receive intensive support services
  and individualized case management. Parents are required to participate in Kids
  First, COTS' 12-week parenting skills training, and in Rent Right, a 9-week course
  in financial literacy and housing search. More than 70% of families graduate into
  permanent housing and independent stable lives. The 100-bed Emergency Shelter for
  Single Adults is located on the first floor of the Mary Isaak Center. Services include
  food, clothing, showers, access to phones and a messaging system, access to computers,
  transportation assistance, mental health and chemical dependency recovery support,
  job skills training, and assistance in obtaining employment and/or public benefits.
  Residents may stay for up to six months and more than 50% graduate into either transitional
  or permanent housing. The Emergency Shelter for Single Adults serves up to 500 individuals
  annually.
