:description: The Latino Commission program design and methodology are derived from
  models of culturally-sensitive treatment for Latinos which have been developed and
  implemented in the last decade by the Latino Commission. The model incorporates
  current best practices in services delivery to Latinos utilizing a solid family-centered
  approach, one that integrates the concepts of conocimiento (self-awareness), respeto
  (respect for others), and confianza (mutual trust) to create a traditional peer
  support system.
