:description: St. Vincent De Paul Society’s Wellness Center is dedicated to responding
  to the call of our community, embracing a holistic healing approach to the needs
  our participants carry daily.  Inspired by our core values of compassion, social
  justice and spirituality, we are committed to bringing wellness, recovery and clinical
  best practices to all who come through our doors. Using a harm reduction model,
  the Wellness Center strives to meet people where they are by focusing on lending
  continued support to those who are struggling with substance abuse issues and other
  debilitating diagnoses. Our daily program consists of stress reduction techniques,
  exercise, selections of personal and spiritual development as well as health topic
  sessions. Good nutritional guidelines play a pivotal role at the Wellness Center.
  We offer healthy free snacks and lunch based on a thoughtfully designed menu of
  fresh local foods with high/dense nutritional value. All are welcome and encouraged
  to participate on the level that best fits their needs.
