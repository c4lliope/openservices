:description: The staff of Jericho Project has determined through professional research
  and numerous years of personal experience that a structured lifestyle is critical
  to long-term recovery.  We believe that it is essential to provide each individual
  with a regular schedule of activities designed to promote stable and responsible
  living.  Jericho Project is an education center for addicts and ex-convicts.  Our
  philosophy is that the drugs were not the main problem, but a symptom of the problem.
  The problem has always been honesty. We work on developing a sense of morals and
  values that can help keep an individual focused and clean. Our philosophy focuses
  on healing the body, mind, and spirit. Our Vocational Training department prepares
  residents for careers in construction, retail, transportation, warehousing and administrative
  careers.  We also have a state of the art fitness gym where residents are trained
  by our certified trainers or a General Physical Trainer.
