:description: The Center for Restorative Justice Works unites children, families and
  communities separated by crime and the criminal justice system. CRJW calls the community
  to set aside pre-judgments about women and men in prison in order to work together
  to accompany families torn apart by the crime and the criminal justice system; create
  awareness about the negative impacts of incarceration on children and families;
  and advocate for programs and policies that restore relationships.  CJRW re-weaves
  the web of relationships that have been torn apart by crime and the policies of
  the criminal justice system. Get on the Bus is a program of The Center for Restorative
  Justice Works. Get On The Bus brings children and their guardians/caregivers from
  throughout the state of California to visit their mothers and fathers in prison.
  An annual event, Get On The Bus offers free transportation for the children and
  their caregivers to the prison, provides travel bags for the children, comfort care
  bags for the caregivers, a photo of each child with his or her parent, and meals
  for the day (breakfast, snacks on the bus, lunch at the prison, and dinner on the
  way home) — all at no cost to the children’s family. On the bus trip home, following
  a four-hour visit, each child receives a teddy bear with a letter from their parent
  and post-event counseling.       www.getonthebus.us
