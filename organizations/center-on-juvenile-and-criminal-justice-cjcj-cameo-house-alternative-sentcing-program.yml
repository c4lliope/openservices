:description: In partnership with the San Francisco Adult Probation Department, the
  Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice’s Cameo House serves criminally involved
  pregnant and parenting women, who are certified as homeless (as defined by the City
  and County of San Francisco).  The goal of Cameo House is to identify eligible women
  who are awaiting adjudication and recommend to the courts that they be sentenced
  to Cameo House in lieu of State Prison or County Jail, when appropriate.  All women
  residing at Cameo House must have at least one child in their custody, have active
  reunification services with at least one of their children or be pregnant at the
  time of enrollment. Cameo House is a 12-month program but clients can remain for
  up to two years.  All residents must be willing to participate in case management
  and other clinical services as a condition of the residency. During their stay at
  Cameo House women are expected to obtain employment, reunify with at least one of
  their children, remain clean and sober (verified through random UAs conducted at
  Cameo House at least once per month), satisfy their Probation requirements, and
  obtain steady employment; with the goal being for them to obtain and sustain permanent
  housing.  Cameo House Residents work intensively with our on-site Case Manager and
  Therapist to insure that all these objectives are met. 
:eligible_population: Formerly incarcerated women with young children. May not have
  a criminal conviction for a sex offense or be a registered sex offender.
