:description: Our primary goal is to change an individual's substance-abusing lifestyle.
  This change comes about through four fundamental processes. First, individuals must
  acknowledge their problems, their own roles and responsibilities in abusing substances.
  Second, they must have the willingness to resolve and change their substance abusing
  behavior. Third, there needs to be an understanding and reconciliation of any conflict
  within themselves, their families and cultural traditions. Finally, they need to
  develop abilities and skills in managing their lives in the social, economic and
  political reality of their environment and community. The AARS-residential is a
  therapeutic community which recognizes the need for providing structure, support
  and opportunity within a multi-cultural environment. It is a highly structured environment
  with defined boundaries, both moral and ethical. The program employs community imposed
  sanctions as well as earned advancement of status and privileges as part of the
  recovery and growth process. Being part of something greater than oneself is an
  especially important factor in facilitating positive growth.
