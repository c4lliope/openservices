:description: 'Preparing to pay for college: Free Application for Federal Student
  Aid (FAFSA). One of the tools you can use to estimate your eligibility for federal
  student financial assistance is the Financial Aid Estimator Tool – FAFSA4caster
  – which is available online at .  You may have heard that if you have been convicted
  of a felony, you are not eligible to receive financial aid. This is not necessarily
  true. A student convicted for the possession or sale of illegal drugs may have eligibility
  suspended if the offense occurred while the student was receiving federal student
  aid (grants, loans, or work-study). When you complete the Free Application for Federal
  Student Aid (FAFSA), you will be asked whether you had a drug conviction for an
  offense that occurred while you were receiving federal student aid. If the answer
  is yes, you will be provided a special worksheet to help you determine whether your
  conviction affects your eligibility for federal student aid. You may preview the
  worksheet in the FAFSA Information section at www.studentaid.ed.gov/pubs. If you
  have been convicted of a forcible or nonforcible sexual offense, and you are subject
  to an involuntary civil commitment upon completion of a period of incarceration
  for that offense, you are ineligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant.'
