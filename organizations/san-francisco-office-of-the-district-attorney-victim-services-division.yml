  counseling, accompanying a victim to court, assistance with victim compensation,
  making funeral arrangements, intervening with employers and creditors when victims
  cannot work, and providing many other services needed to restore a crime victim’s
  life.  Our Victim Services staff is diverse and committed to providing culturally
