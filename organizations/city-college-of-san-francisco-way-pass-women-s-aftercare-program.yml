:description: The Women’s Aftercare Program and Services is a collaborative project
  with City College of San Francisco, under the auspices of the Health Science Department
  and the Women’s Studies Department. We are designed to address the unique needs
  of self-identified women who are formerly incarcerated. We serve women coming home
  from prisons, jails, and drug programs. It is our belief that education is the best
  alternative to incarceration and it is our desire to assist our sisters in their
  academic endeavors.
