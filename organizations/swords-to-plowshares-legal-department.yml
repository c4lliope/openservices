:description: War causes wounds and suffering that last beyond the battlefield. Our
  mission is to heal the wounds, to restore dignity, hope and self-sufficiency to
  all veterans in need, and to significantly reduce homelessness and poverty among
  veterans. Many veterans never receive the benefits for which they are eligible.
  The Legal Department of Swords to Plowshares helps veterans to cut through the extremely
  arduous VA benefits application process by providing free attorney representation,
  case management, and advocacy to indigent veterans by seeking benefits.
