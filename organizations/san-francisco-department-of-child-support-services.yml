  The Department's mission is to empower parents to provide for the economic and medical support needs of their children. COAP is a program for eligible noncustodial parents to reduce past-due child support (arrears) debt owed to the State.  This debt is owed because the State supported the family while the dependent children were on public assistance (welfare) or in foster care.  If you qualify for COAP you may offer to pay an amount that is less than the full amount you owe.  Any reduction in your arrears and interest owed will be based on your income and assets.  Arrears may be paid in a lump sum or in monthly installments over 36 months, depending on the individual circumstances.  www.sfgov.org/dcss or www.facebook.com/sfdcss
