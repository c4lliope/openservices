:description: Saved by Grace is a faith-based structured program dealing with all
  of life’s issues. Our focus is to rebuild self-esteem and help individuals readjust
  into society as productive citizens. We take a faith based approach toward recovery
  and education. We mirror our beliefs in our actions. We teach faith but it is not
  a requirement for entrance. We focus on teaching a positive outlook toward rebuilding
  families torn by crime, drugs, and abuse to others as well as self. Our mission
  is to educate, rehabilitate, graduate, and restore the youth and adults back into
  the life they were meant to live.
