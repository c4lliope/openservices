:description: People Assisting The Homeless (PATH) is a family of agencies working
  together to end homelessness for individuals, families, and communities throughout
  Southern California. We strive to do this by prioritizing housing while providing
  customized supportive services for people in need. Our agencies each address homelessness
  in a different way—supportive services, permanent housing development, support for
  homeless families, and community engagement—all of which ultimately help the people
  we serve make it home.
:eligible_population: Homeless individuals, families, veterans.
