  mental health programs: Therapeutic Visitation Services for families recently separated
  and in the process of reunification; Outpatient Mental Health Services for children
  needing individual therapy or families needing family therapy; and Early Childhood
  Mental Health Services for infants and young children to address their emotional
  and behavioral development.  Children seen through our program need to be Full-Scope
  Medi-Cal eligible.'
