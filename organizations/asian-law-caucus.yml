:description: The mission of the Asian Law Caucus is to promote, advance, and represent
  the legal and civil rights of Asian and Pacific Islander (API) communities. Recognizing
  that social, economic, political and racial inequalities continue to exist in the
  United States, the Asian Law Caucus is committed to the pursuit of equality and
  justice for all sectors of our society, with a specific focus directed toward addressing
  the needs of low-income, immigrant and underserved APIs.

  Since the vast majority of Asians and Pacific Islanders in America are immigrants and refugees, the Caucus strives to create informed and educated communities empowered to assert their rights and to participate actively in American society. This perspective is reflected in our broad strategy which integrates the provision of legal services, educational programs, community organizing initiatives and advocacy. www.asianlawcaucus.org
