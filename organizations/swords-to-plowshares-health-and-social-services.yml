:description: The vision of Swords to Plowshares is that all veterans will have access
  to the care and services they need and deserve to rebuild their lives. War causes
  wounds and suffering that last beyond the battlefield. Swords to Plowsharesâ€™ mission
  is to heal the wounds, to restore dignity, hope and self-sufficiency to all veterans
  in need, and to significantly reduce homelessness and poverty among veterans. Founded
  in 1974, Swords to Plowshares is a community-based not-for-profit organization that
  provides counseling and case management, employment and training, housing, and legal
  assistance to veterans in the San Francisco Bay Area. We promote and protect the
  rights of veterans through advocacy, public education and partnerships with local,
  state and national entities.
