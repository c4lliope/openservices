:description: We are happy to announce that the Free Clothing Program will be moving
  to our new building located at 121 Golden Gate Ave. As of February 3rd, 2015, we
  will be on the 2nd floor above the new Dining Room and next to the new Social Work
  Center. It is our hope that centralizing our services will greatly improve our guests’
  experience here at St. Anthony’s thus enabling us to fully serve each and every
  man, woman and child who comes through our doors with immediate, accessible and
  responsive wrap-around services.
