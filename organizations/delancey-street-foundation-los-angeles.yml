:description: Delancey Street is a residential education center for former substance
  abusers and ex-convicts. Its philosophy is that the people with the problems can
  teach themselves to become the solution. The program requires a minimum two-year
  commitment, and many individuals stay for longer. The Delancey Street Foundation
  Los Angeles facility is located near midtown, right off the Hollywood freeway. The
  facility, housing approximately 300 residents, was constructed as a 220 room hotel;
  the Mission style building complex includes a huge ballroom for catering events
  for up to 500 people, with smaller catering rooms as well. The buildings surround
  a large 8,000 square foot tropical garden with cascading waterfalls. Residents have
  completely renovated the building since we bought it in 1993. In order to make the
  hotel more of a home, residents turned the guest rooms into living units ranging
  from dorms for the newcomers into small apartments as residents earn their way to
  more spacious living quarters, and opened up the dining area to 6,000 square feet
  for resident meals. Delancey Street-Los Angeles also has a 50,000 square foot warehouse
  Business Complex located in Montebello. This complex houses a number of Delancey
  Training Schools including Moving & Trucking, Automotive, Auto Body Shop, Warehouse
  Shipping and Receiving, Terrarium, Ceramics and Iron Handcraft Works and Sales.
