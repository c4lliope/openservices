:description: Our Common Ground (OCG) is a treatment program for adults with substance
  abuse and mental health problems. We help people who realize they cannot do it alone
  â€“ that they need the support, encouragement and challenge from other like-minded
  individuals who are working toward meaningful and productive lives, without drugs.
  Our nurturing environment helps each individual take responsibility for his or her
  own life and build skills for long term substance abuse recovery, rehabilitation
  and emotional and physical success. Many come back later and tell us about their
  happiness and success as parents, workers, students and contributing members of
  their communities due to the rehabilitation therapy they have received in our treatment
  center.
