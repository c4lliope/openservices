:description: The Mill Street Center is the "front door" of our Adult Services Program,
  the 55-bed Mill Street Center in San Rafael is the county's only night-to-night
  emergency shelter for homeless individuals. It serves both men and women in separate
  dormitory-style rooms. A network of volunteers from three dozen churches and community
  groups shares a monthly rotation to provide a home-cooked hot meal to Mill Street
  residents. This significant gift has endured since the center opened more than 25
  years ago.  As space becomes available, committed residents "graduate" to New Beginnings
  Center, a second-step shelter that allows residents to stay up to 6 months.
