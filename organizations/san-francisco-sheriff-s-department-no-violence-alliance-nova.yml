:description: The primary goal of the NoVA Project is to address the violence plaguing
  San Francisco and in particular, the significantly high crime communities of Bayview
  Hunters Point, Western Addition, and the Mission Districts, by providing intensive
  services to formerly incarcerated individuals with a history of violence to aid
  in their reentry into the community and reduce recidivism. The NoVA Project approach
  engages men and women, and encourages them to take control of their violent behavior
  through rehabilitation, and to the extent possible, successfully reenter the community
  as a productive member of society. The comprehensive approach stresses offender
  accountability and violence prevention education.
