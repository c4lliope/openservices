  and find permanent housing.  Our organization’s mission is to empower and transform
  lives by delivering innovative solutions to combat poverty and break the cycle of
  homelessness. The Weingart Center transitions homeless men and women from street
  life to self-sufficiency through a variety of programs and services, such as: Workforce
  Development, Mental Health & Substance Abuse Treatment, Case Management, Veterans
  Transition Housing, Women’s Renaissance, Re-entry Programs, and various other solutions.
